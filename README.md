### Welcome,

One of my professional development activities during my career has been the creation of educational software, primarily for teaching college-level mathematics.  I have uploaded a few of the more recent packages I have created, both for education and department-level administration.  I hope that you find the packages I have shared to be useful to you.

#### Mathematical Applications

- **[Cryptography Explorer](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Cryptography-Explorer)**: The Cryptography Explorer program was developed for the investigation of cryptography and cryptanalysis. It was developed as a teaching tool to try to remove the tedious calculations but still require the user to make the decisions for the processes and analysis. I have also included a set of notes that can be used as textbook supplements when teaching Cryptography.
- **[Fractal Generator](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Fractal-Generator)**: The Fractal Generator is designed to display images produced from complex and real parametric dynamical systems. Its main purpose is to allow the user to experiment with their own formulas in the dynamical system.
- **[PascGaloisJE](https://github.com/mathprofdes/PascGaloisJE)**: PascGalois JE is a platform independent program developed for the exploration of one and two dimensional cellular automata over finite group structures. The supported group structures are Zn, Zn (under multiplication), Dn, Sn, the Quaternions, Qn (Generalized Quaternions) and Cn (Dicyclic groups).
- **[PascGaloisZn](https://github.com/mathprofdes/PascGaloisZn)**: PascGalois Zn is a platform independent program developed for the exploration of one and two dimensional cellular automata over the ring Zn. 

#### Administrative Applications

- **[Academic Scheduler](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Academic-Scheduler)**: The Academic Scheduler is an application that allows the user to create, save, and export a semester schedule for an academic department.
- **[Schedule Card Creator](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Schedule-Card-Creator)**: The Schedule Card Creator is an application that allows the user to create, save, and export a weekly schedule image that can be posted outside an office door or dropped into a web page or a CMS such as Canvas.
- **[Grade Book](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Grade-Book)**: The Grade Book program is an electronic grade book for storing and reporting student grades.

#### Other Applications

- **[LaTeX Table Creator](https://github.com/mathprofdes/LaTeX-Table-Creator)**: The LaTeX Table Creator is an application that allows the user to input data into a grid and export the contents to LaTeX syntax given a few options.
- **[Text Converter](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Text-Converter)**: The Text Converter is a simple text and numeric manipulation application that allows the user to do some specialized conversions that may not be available in a standard text editor or programming IDE.

#### Course Materials and Example Code

- **[Introductory Java Programming](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Introductory-Java-Programming)**: Course materials and example programs for an introductory programming course in Java.
- **[CSI in C++](https://github.com/mathprofdes/CSI-in-Cpp)**: Course materials and example programs for a CSI class in C++.
- **[CSII in C++](https://github.com/mathprofdes/CSII-in-Cpp)**: Course materials and example programs for a CSII class in C++.
- **[Algorithms and Data Structures in C++](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-in-Cpp)**: Course materials and example programs for an Algorithms and Data Structures class in C++.
- **[Computer Graphics in C++](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Computer-Graphics-in-Cpp)**: Course materials and example programs for a Computer Graphics class in C++.
- **[Computer Graphics in Python](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Computer-Graphics-in-Python)**: Course materials and example programs for a Computer Graphics class in Python.
- **[High Performance Computing in C](https://github.com/mathprofdes/High-Performance-Computing-in-C)**: Course materials and example programs for a High Performance Computing class in C/C++.
