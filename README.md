### Welcome,

I am currently a mathematics professor at Salisbury University in Salisbury Maryland.  I have been teaching mathematics and computer science classes for over 35 years and one of my professional development activities during that time has been the creation of educational software, primarily for teaching college-level mathematics.  I have uploaded a few of the more recent packages I have created, both for education and department-level administration.  I hope that you find the packages I have shared to be useful to you.

#### Mathematical Applications

- **[Cryptography Explorer](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Cryptography-Explorer)**: The Cryptography Explorer program was developed for the investigation of cryptography and cryptanalysis. It was developed as a teaching tool to try to remove the tedious calculations but still require the user to make the decisions for the processes and analysis. 
- **[Fractal Generator](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Fractal-Generator)**: The Fractal Generator is designed to display images produced from complex and real parametric dynamical systems. Its main purpose is to allow the user to experiment with their own formulas in the dynamical system.
- **[PascGaloisJE](https://github.com/mathprofdes/PascGaloisJE)**: PascGalois JE is a platform independent program developed for the exploration of one and two dimensional cellular automata over finite group structures. The supported group structures are Zn, Zn (under multiplication), Dn, Sn, the Quaternions, Qn (Generalized Quaternions) and Cn (Dicyclic groups).
- **[PascGaloisZn](https://github.com/mathprofdes/PascGaloisZn)**: PascGalois Zn is a platform independent program developed for the exploration of one and two dimensional cellular automata over the ring Zn. 

#### Administrative Applications

- **[Academic Scheduler](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Academic-Scheduler)**: The Academic Scheduler is an application that allows the user to create, save, and export a semester schedule for an academic department.
- **[Schedule Card Creator](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Schedule-Card-Creator)**: The Schedule Card Creator is an application that allows the user to create, save, and export a weekly schedule image that can be posted outside an office door or dropped into a web page or a CMS such as Canvas.
- **[Grade Book](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Grade-Book)**: The Grade Book program is an electronic grade book for storing and reporting student grades.

#### Other Applications

- **[LaTeX Table Creator](https://github.com/mathprofdes/LaTeX-Table-Creator)**: The LaTeX Table Creator is an application that allows the user to input data into a grid and export the contents to LaTeX syntax given a few options.
- **[Text Converter](https://github.com/mathprofdes/Text-Converter)**: The Text Converter is a simple text and numeric manipulation application that allows the user to do some specialized conversions that may not be available in a standard text editor or programming IDE.
