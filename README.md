### Welcome,

I am currently a mathematics professor at Salisbury University in Salisbury Maryland.  I have been teaching mathematics and computer science classes for over 30 years and one of my professional development activities during that time has been the creation of educational software, primarily for teaching college-level mathematics.  I have uploaded a few of the more recent packages I have created, both for education and departmental-level administration.  I hope that you find the packages I have shared to be useful to you.
